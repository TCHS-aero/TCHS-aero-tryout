WRITE YOUR SOLUTION HERE.

Note the available API calls:
move_forwards() / go() : moves forwards in the direction specified by direction.
turn_right() / tr() : turns right, or clockwise. This increments direction.
turn_left() / tl() : turns left, or counter-clockwise. This decrements direction.
get_grid() -> list : Returns the state of the grid and everything on it. '.' = empty, 'o' = fruit, '#' = wall. The robot will not be included.
get_position() -> list : Returns the position of the robot as a list in the format: [position_x, position_y]
get_direction() -> int : Returns the direction the robot is facing as an int. 0: North , 1: East , 2: South , 3: West

# Your algorithm must end with a call to grade().
# Calling grade() will halt execution and print your score.
# You may call grade() at any point, but note that no operations will succeed after grade() is called.
# When grade() is called, the robot's position will be queried. If it is equal to (5,5), the "reach the end" task is successful.
# If it is called after moving away from the end, you will not receive the points for that task.
