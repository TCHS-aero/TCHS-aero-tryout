SAMPLE PROBLEM TEST

YOUR TASK
Your task is to design the movement for a ground-based robot.

The robot lives on a 6x6 grid. It can only inhabit one tile at any time, and it begins in the top-left corner (0,0).
Your task is to use the provided interface to move the robot to the bottom right corner (5,5) and collect as many fruits as possible.

Your program will receive input in the form of function calls.
When you run your program, it will import the required tester modules, and send a single call to `initialize_robot()`, passing a single argument: the state of the board, represented as a two-dimensional List.

You will have access to three api functions:
move_forwards() : alias - go() : moves the robot one tile in the direction it is facing. 
rotate_right() : alias - rr() : rotates the robot to the right 90 degrees.
rotate_left() : alias - rl() : rotates the robot to the left 90 degrees.

The task comes in three difficulties that you may select from.

BASIC: No changes
HARD: There are new 3-6 "walls" on the grid that the robot must navigate around.
TOUGH: The robot now only "sees" tiles orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to itself (<= 9 tiles at any time)
